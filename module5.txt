1) Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django?

=> 	Django is the best framework for web applications, as it allows developers to use modules for faster development.
     As a developer, you can make use of these modules to create apps, websites from an existing source. It speeds up the
     development process greatly, as you do not have to code everything from scratch.

	
	1. Install Django: pip install django
	2. Create a project: django-admin startproject yourproject
	3. Navigate to the project directory: cd yourproject
	4. Create an app: python manage.py startapp yourapp
	5. Configure the database in settings.py.
	6. Apply migrations: python manage.py migrate
	7. (Optional) Create a superuser: python manage.py createsuperuser
	8. Run the development server: python manage.py runserver
	9. Develop your app by editing files in the app directory.

2) How to check installed version of django?

=>	Simply type python -m django --version or type pip freeze to see all the versions of installed modules including
	Django.

3) Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?

=>	The django-admin.py makemessages command in Django is used for creating or updating translation files. It scans 
	your project for text marked for translation, generating files that can be translated into different languages for
	internationalization and localization.

4) What is Django URLs?make program to create django urls

=>	URLconf is a set of patterns that Django will try to match the requested URL to find the correct view.
	
	# urls.py

	from django.urls import path
	from . import views

	urlpatterns = [
   		path('', views.home, name='home'),
   		path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
   		path('contact/', views.contact, name='contact'),
	]

	
	# views.py

	from django.shortcuts import render

	def home(request):
   	  return render(request, 'yourapp/home.html')

	def about(request):
   	   return render(request, 'yourapp/about.html')

	def contact(request):
           return render(request, 'yourapp/contact.html')

5)What is a QuerySet?Write program to create a new Post object in database:

=>	In Django, a QuerySet is a representation of a database query. It allows you to interact with the database by providing an
	abstraction over the SQL queries. QuerySets are used to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data from a database table.

	Key points about QuerySets:

	1)Lazy Evaluation
	2)Chaining Methods
	3)ORM Integration
	4)Caching
	
	===
	# Assuming you have a models.py file with a Post model defined
	from myapp.models import Post

	# Create a new Post object
	new_post = Post()

	# Set attributes for the Post object
	new_post.title = "My First Post"
	new_post.content = "This is the content of my first post."
	new_post.author = "John Doe"

	# Save the Post object to the database
	new_post.save()

6) Mention what command line can be used to load data into Django?

=>	To load data into Django you have to use the command line Django-admin.py loaddata. The command line will searches the data 
	and loads the contents of the named fixtures into the database.

7) Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?

=>	makemessages Runs over the entire source tree of the current directory and pulls out all strings marked for translation. It 
	creates (or updates) a message file in the conf/locale (in the Django tree) or locale (for project and application) directory.
